# a. StackBlitz instructions

We'll use the Angular Generator to create other Angular files such as interfaces and services.

The local development instructions uses the Angular CLI command `ng g i interfaces/todo-item` to create the `interfaces` folder and the interface file in one command. Unfortunately, we have to work around a small bug in StackBlitz and create the folder manually.

Right click on the `app` folder and select **New Folder** and name the folder `interfaces`.

Now we can use the Angular Generator. Right click on `interfaces` and select **Angular Generator**, then select **Interface**.

Type `todo-item` in the text box to create the interface.

Only component files have HTML templates so we don't need to shuffle any code around.
